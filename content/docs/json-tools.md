## Jo
**Easily create valid json from a script**

Simple key value
```bash
jo key=value key2="another value"
```
Outputs
```json
{"key":"value","key2":"another value"}
```

Embed calls to build up objects
```bash
jo -p key=$(jo foo=bar) 
```
Outputs
```json
{ "key": { "foo": "bar" } }
```

**Take json and output it as individual lines with a path to them for easy grep/sed etc, can also take lines and turn them back into json**

```bash
jo key=value key2="another value" | gron
```

```
json = {};
json.key = "value";
json.key2 = "â€œanother";
```
